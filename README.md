# OS_Project_2
This is my Operating Systems Project 2 on **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**.
<br/>
<br/>:mortar_board: **Implements the following:**
    <br/> 1. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
    <br/>2. CLook
    <br/>3. FScan
<br/>
<br/>:lock: **Challenges I Faced:**
    <br/>This was my first time working with a Disk Scheduling simulator, so it took 
    <br/> some time to get used to. 
    <br/> I struggled to answer the questions in the document in full detail, due to
    <br/> the time constraint. 
<br/>
<br/> :page_facing_up: **Notes:**
<br/> - I have added the simulator python file for reference.
